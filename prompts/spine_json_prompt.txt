Convert the three book spine descriptions into JSON using the schema below.
Do your best to fit the descriptions into the limitations of the schema.

Output ONLY valid JSON.
No markdown. No explanations.
Do not invent text that is not explicitly mentioned.

SPINE
- Size: 240x800
- Origin (0,0) is top-left
- Background: red unless clearly specified otherwise
- Allowed colors: red, white, black

DRAW ORDER
Elements are drawn in the order listed in "elements".
Earlier elements are behind later ones.

BOUNDING BOXES
Each element uses a bounding box:
- x1,y1 = top-left
- x2,y2 = bottom-right
All coordinates must be within the spine (0..240, 0..800).

SUPPORTED ELEMENTS
1) rect
  - A filled rectangle covering its bounding box

2) circle
  - An ellipse drawn inside the bounding box
  - If width == height, it is a circle

3) text
  Required fields:
  - text: string
    - Use explicit line breaks with "\n" when the description specifies stacked lines
    - For letter-by-letter vertical stacking, include one character per line
  - align: left|center|right|justify
  - direction: horizontal|vertical_rotated|vertical_stacked
  - font: one of the allowed fonts
  - fit: contain|cover
  - allow_nonlinear_scale: true|false
    - If true, renderer may scale X and Y independently to fit the box - be mindfull of the box size, text might become unreadable
    - If false, renderer scales uniformly

ALLOWED FONTS (choose one)
["Baskerville","Garamond","Georgia","Times","Didot","Helvetica","Arial","Futura","GillSans","Courier"]

FINAL NOTES
- JSON only
- Use only allowed colors and fonts
- All geometry defined by bounding boxes
- No font sizes; text is auto-fit by the renderer
- Elements appear strictly in listed order, last elements are in the front
- Text is large enough to be read, remember the whole image is only 240 pixels wide
- Generate exactly 3 layouts, in the same order as Description 1..3
- Maximum 10 elements per spine.
