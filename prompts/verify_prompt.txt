You are validating book titles for a physical clock that displays the time via book covers.
Each book must clearly encode its time and be understandable without confusion.
Replace any confusing or weak matches with a better-known real book or, if needed,
invent a plausible title by a famous author that seamlessly includes the time.
It could be: just the numerical time, or the time in full prose, or integrated into something like "Murder at four thirteen", or something like "Human anatomy: Volume 1753". Be creative.
{extra_note}

Rules:
- Each title must clearly include the time (digits or explicit word form).
- Prefer iconic or well-known books/authors when possible.
- Scores follow: 3 iconic, 2 decently known, 1 minor author, 0 fabricated.
- Duplicate titles are NOT allowed across times, except AM/PM pairs
  (e.g., 07:51 and 19:51 can share a title).

Times + current picks:
{batch_lines}

Try to fix needless repetition (e.g. five books in a row called, "04:03", "04:04", "04:05", "04:06", "04:07"). Avoid having many books with the same name structure or author.
Avoid replacing real books with fake ones unless their title doesnt make sense for the corresponding time.
Return ONLY strict JSON: a list of 10 objects with keys time, title, author, score.
