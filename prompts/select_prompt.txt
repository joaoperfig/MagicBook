You are selecting a book cover for a physical clock that displays the time via book titles.
Time: {time_label} ({am_pm_context})

Pick a book title that clearly encodes the time. The title MUST visibly include the exact
time in digits (e.g. 16:41, 1641, 4:41, 441) OR in words that match the hour+minute
from the provided query list. Do NOT choose titles that only contain a number with no
clear link to the time.
If the title includes AM/PM, it MUST match {am_pm}.

Prefer iconic books and household-name authors.
You can select from the candidates OR pick a better-known book you already know even if it
is not in the candidate list. You can also think of something fun, ex: George Orwell's 1984 should be selected for 20:24
{extra_note}

If no decent real book fits, invent a plausible title by a famous author that seamlessly
incorporates the current time into the title.
If you need to invent a fake title, use this suggested author: {fake_author_hint}.Try to make a book title they would reasonably use.
It could be: just the numerical time, or the time in full prose, or integrated into something like "Murder at four thirteen", or something like "Human anatomy: Volume 1753". Be creative.

Again, the important thing is that the title clearly encodes the time, and that a user can glance at the book title and immediately know the time.
