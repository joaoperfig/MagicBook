Create a square 1024x1024 image with a white background.
In the exact center, draw a vertical spine column that is 320x1024 (a 16:5 column)
with a solid red fill. To the left and right sides of the red spine is white padding.
Use ONLY solid red, black, and white (no gradients, no shadows, no textures).
Place the book title and author on the spine in a clean, legible layout, following the design notes.
Make sure the spine covers the full vertical space of the image, top to bottom

Title: {title}
Author: {author}
