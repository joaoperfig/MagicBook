You are designing book spine graphics.

Create 3 distinct, simple spine design descriptions for the book below.
All designs must use ONLY solid red, black, and white (no gradients, no shading).
Each description should be 1-2 sentences and include:
- Basic description that this is a vertical spine for a red book
- Where the title and author appear on the spine (is the text horizontal, rotated 90 degrees, stacked
?, how are the words separated, what style of font and colors are used)
- Description of graphic motif or other design elements
- A clean, minimal layout, easy to read and identify
Make sure to keep the descriptions different from each other, describing alternative designs that are different but still make sense for the book they would be on.
The book is red - at least the top and bottom edges of the spine have to be red.
You can add design elements such as panels or rules. Try to have variety in complexity, have at least one of the spines be just text on the plain red background, and you can make the others iteratively complex.
Make sure your design is readable even on a small book, no tiny text.
Make sure to include all numerical values in the title, like volume numbering, if applicable
Do not include a publisher name or logo unless specified in the author
Prioritize readability. Its a book spine, not a cover. 


Book title: "{title}"
Author: "{author}"

Return ONLY strict JSON as an array of 3 strings.
